This is the .zip mods folder for version 0.2.1

To play with this on steam: replace the existing TerraTeam-Spelunker.zip mod folder with this one
To play with this in the Godot editor: move the TerraTeam-Spelunker.zip folder into res://mods

Changes: 
-The keeper now puts drops into the backpack, rather than carrying them behind on carry lines
-The keeper now throws items out of the inventory when the drop button is pressed or held, (using the same aim logic as assessor)
-The keeper can switch between slots while holding the drop button by using movement inputs (WASD, joystick)
